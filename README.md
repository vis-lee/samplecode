# Sample Code From Vis
Hi, the sample code in this repository is only for reference.

## Sample Code in C
The folder, BlockDeviceDriverSampleCode, contains a sample code of linux block device driver implementation. The entry point would be DMS\_VDDriver.c, and I also recommend that you can take a look at DMS\_Mem\_Pool.c, SSocket.c, SSockets\_Manager.c. also, I put a flow chart of SSocket, SSockets_Flow.jpg, for detail which would help you to catch it easier.

## Sample Code in Java 
The folder java contains two Java projects, "RCManager_SampleCode" and "JenkinsTestCases", that you could import into Eclipse and run the test. 

RCManager is a module that could record reference count and transmit to remotesite. The entry point of it would be addRCUpdate() in file "org.itri.ccma.server.namenode.rcmanager.RCManager.java".

JenkinsTestCases is a test cases project for RCManager, you can run TestAll.java to test this module.

Thank you for reading.
